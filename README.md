### Light Text Classification Algorithm Based on Graph Convolutional Neural Network via Importance Sampling  

#### For confidentiality, only the main code is made public. All code will be made pubilc soon.
There are mainly two parts for my code. One for Chinese datasets, the other for English datasets.   
For each dataset, I have tried twelve methods: text gcn, inductive gcn, bert,etc.
Detailed usage steps will be introduced soon.
