### Light Text Classification Algorithm Based on Graph Convolutional Neural Network via Importance Sampling  

There are mainly two parts for my code. One for Chinese datasets, the other for English datasets.   
For each dataset, I have tried twelve methods: text gcn, text sgc, inductive gcn, bert,etc.
Only part of codes were uploaded. All codes and detailed usage steps will be introduced soon.
