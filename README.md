### Light Text Classification Algorithm Based on Graph Convolutional Neural Network via Importance Sampling  

There are mainly two parts for my code. One for Chinese datasets, the other for English datasets.   
For each dataset, I have tried twelve meethods: text gcn, text sgc, inductive gcn, bert,etc.  
Detailed usage steps will be introduced soon.
